**How a request gets served :**

Computers connected to the web are called clients and servers.

1. _Clients are the web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome)_.

2. _Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser_.

_When you type HTTP request to your browser the first thing that happens is a Domain Name Server (DNS) matches your request to an IP address. Then the browser sends an HTTP request to the server and the server sends back an HTTP response. The browser begins rendering the HTML on the page while also requesting any additional resources such as CSS, JavaScript etc. Each subsequent request completes a request/response cycle and is rendered in turn by the browser. Then once the page is loaded some sites e)(though not min will make further asynchronous requests_.
