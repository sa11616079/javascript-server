**MERN Stack :** 

_MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. MERN stack is a web development framework. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components. MERN is the stack of choice for today’s web developers looking to move quickly, particularly for those with React.js experience. Here are the details of what each of these components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack_.

**1. MongoDB :** 

_If your application stores any data (user profiles, content, comments, uploads, events, etc.), then you’re going to want a database that’s just as easy to work with as Angular, Express, and Node.It is a document-oriented and No-SQL database used to store the application data_.

**2. NodeJS:**

_It is JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser. Express.js is a server-side framework, running inside a Node.js server. Express.js bills itself as a “fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js,” and that is indeed exactly what it is. Express.js has powerful models for URL routing (matching an incoming URL with a server function), and handling HTTP requests and responses_.

**3. ExpressJS :**

_It is a framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed_.

**4. ReactJS :**

_It is a library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application. Top tier of the MERN stack is React.js, the declarative JavaScript framework for creating dynamic client-side applications in HTML. React build up complex interfaces through simple Components, connect them to data on your backend server, and render them as HTML_.
