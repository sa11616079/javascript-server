5 features vs code

1. Intellisense
IntelliSense is code auto-complete meets artificial intelligence. This utility provides a list of suggestions along with a short hint or description as we are writing codes. These is derived from several contextual factors such as the programming language, the syntax, the variables, the functions as well as all the codes within the file.

IntelliSense supports a number of programming language out-of-the-box, including Sass, LESS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP. Some extensions to include IntelliSense for other programming languages are also available. It is a great feature to improve productivity.

2. Peek
While coding, you may often forget a particular function, where the function is initially defined, and what are the required parameters.

With Peek, you can select a function then hit Shift + F12. The selection expands into an inline window showing the complete definition of the function as well as where the function is defined. The feature currently works in C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET, and a few other programming languages.

3. CLI
Similar to SublimeText with its subl command line, Visual Studio Code is equipped a CLI named code and it is easy to install.

In Windows, the CLI will have already been installed along with the app. The CLI is accessible through the Command Prompt. In OS X, it can be installed and uninstalled through the Command Palette.

You can use the CLI to open a particular directory to Visual Studio Code, or open your current project directory in Terminal or Command Prompt directly from the editor.

4. Built-in Git
Visual Studio Code has Git built right in the editor. On the left of the sidebar, you will find the Git icon where you can initialize Git as well as perform several Git commands such as commit, pull, push, rebase, publish, and look into the changes within the file.

In addition, if you are making changes on a Git repository, the Visual Studio will show color indicators in the code editor gutter, indicating where you have made the modifications.

5. Task Runner
Last but not least, Visual Studio Code also has a built-in Task Runner, which provides some level of convenience.

To use this feature, we can either set a tasks.json file or through some popular Task configuration like Grunt, Gulp, or MSBuild if provided. Once the configuration is set, we can run the Task Runner through the Command Palette by typing Run Task. Typing Tasks will list all related commands.

5 useful plugins vscode

1.Auto Rename Tag
Auto Rename Tag automatically renames paired HTML/XML tags. It can either change the opening tag or closing tag, after which the corresponding tag is changed to match.
After this plugin is enabled, there will be no more mismatched tags. It also saves the effort to double type both opening and closing tags. It works perfectly.

2.Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 shows matching brackets by using the same colors. This helps to identify the opening and closing brackets.

3.Indent-Rainbow
Indent-Rainbow colorizes the indentation in front of the text, alternating four different colors on each step. This helps to make indentations more readable.Combining Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 and Indent-Rainbow makes your code much more readable.

4.Code Spell Checker
Code Spell Checker is a spell checker that considers camelCase code. The blue underlines make it obvious which words need to be corrected.If you’d like to treat “unmount” below as a correct spelling, you can right click to add it to the user (global) dictionary or the folder (local) dictionary.

5.Sort JS object keys
Sort JS object keys is a tool to alphabetically sort the keys for a selected JavaScript object. It can sort the keys in normal order or reversed order.

6.quokka.js
Quokka.js is a developer productivity tool for rapid JavaScript / TypeScript prototyping. Runtime values are updated and displayed in your IDE next to your code, as you type.

7.gitlens
GitLens supports the additional Git capabilities, beyond the VS Code built-in ones. It helps the user better understand code with a quick glimpse into when and why a line or code block was changed — as well as who changed it.
Jump back through history to gain further insights as to how and why the code evolved. It allows effortless exploration of the history and evolution of a codebase. The vscode-gitlens features are very well documented on its official site.
After installing GitLens, you’ll find this GitLens button on the left. If you click on it, the left panel shows all kinds of Git information: REPOSITORIES, FILE HISTORY, LINE HISTORY, etc. If you click a line on the open file on the right, it shows the blame information.

8.github extension
The GitHub Extension for Visual Studio makes it easy to connect to and work with your repositories on GitHub and GitHub Enterprise from directly within Visual Studio 2015 or newer. Clone existing repositories or create new ones and start collaborating!
